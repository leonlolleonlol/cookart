# COOKART  
## Summer project 2023
This is a prototype of a possible company that praises home made food  
A lot of friends and colleagues rely on their parents or on take-out food to eat.  
That is the reason why I started this project.  
Ideally, this website will teach young adults and teens how to cook with user friendly UI.  
Every user can share their recipies and the site will ressemble to a social media app.  
There will be a cooking section and a plus section: the art of cooking, where  
users can create pieces of art with their food and post it.
