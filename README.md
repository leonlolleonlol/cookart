# COOKART  
## Summer project 2023  
### Description  
This is a prototype of a possible company that praises home made food.  
### Reason of this creation    
A lot of friends and colleagues rely on their parents or on take-out food to eat.  
That is the reason why I started this project.  
### Purpose  
Ideally, this website will teach young adults and teens how to cook with user friendly UI.  
Every user can share their recipies and the site will ressemble to a social media app.  
There will be a cooking section and a plus section: the art of cooking, where  
users can create pieces of art with their food and post it.  
### Source  
The base of my project is one of my repositeries : [Simulation-circuit-electrique](https://github.com/leonlolleonlol/Simulation-circuit-electrique)
